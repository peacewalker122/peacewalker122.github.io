## The Unexpected End
Once in my life, I never thought this day would happen to me. One month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. Our relationship lasted for 3 years, 4 months, and 27 days – yes, I still remember it precisely.

We broke up because I was tired. I constantly gave feedback and complained about things I felt were inappropriate for a 'couple'. There were countless fights provoked by these complaints, but in the end, they also became the final chapter of our story.

The remnants of our time together still live in my head. Yesterday, as I was about to sleep, memories of our special dates, shared love, and laughter suddenly resurfaced. I end and start each day thinking about this. Sometimes I can't believe this is happening to us. Sometimes, a small part of me shouts, asking me to believe in her again.
## A Conversation with a Friend
Long story short, I met a friend after a long time. When our conversation turned to relationships, I opened up:

> "You know what? I had a relationship with a girl I met online 3 years ago. We broke up 1 month ago. Honestly, when we first broke up, I didn't think much about it. But three weeks later, the memories of our relationship came flooding back. Sometimes, I even send her messages, even though she doesn't respond. There's a small part of me that still believes in her, that she would change and control her emotions."

I even asked on an anonymous forum:
> "I wonder how likely it is for a girl to change if I had strong feedback that I can't live like this with her if she always wants me to feed her ego and believes 'a man's love must be greater than a woman's'?"

The majority said NO. If she wanted to change, she would do it for herself. But love? Sure, it can change anyone into their best or worst version.

I confessed to my friend:
> "I haven't even deleted her photos from my gallery, even though we haven't talked for almost a month. I'm putting my trust in that 'small part' of me. Sometimes she appears in my dreams, which implies she's still living in my mind. All this 'fake reality' is really tiring me out these days."

I've become open to internet suggestions. While scrolling through TikTok, I found content talking about this – from a female perspective, interestingly. The essence was:
"I have to trust myself and be brave enough to make a decision by 'killing' that small part because I don't want to live in that situation again or put my life in uncertainty."

My friend replied with wisdom:

> "You already did your best to maintain your relationship, right? You have to acknowledge yourself; you have your own limits. Even Jesus had His limits – it's normal. Don't be mean to yourself. If she didn't care about your feedback, it already shows she won't change. No matter how much effort you put in, it will result in nothing. Stop putting your mind and time into something like that. I agree with those people – it's hard for people to change if they don't want to commit to themselves. Time is ticking. Take your time, don't think about her again, kill that 'small part' in you, and move on."
