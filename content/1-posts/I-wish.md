<!--I can make some improvement on 'pengenalan masalah'-->

Once in my life, I've never thought this day will happen to me. 1 month ago I'm brokeup with my girlfriend the relationship itself last for 3 years 4 months and 27 days. but the reminance are back, date we celebrate, love we have, and jokes we laugh together are now just being an eternal memory. I end of this day & start this day with just think of this, sometimes I can't believe this happening to us, sometimes there's a little part on shouting and ask me believe on you again, long story short I met my friend again after a long time,talk and when the topic change when into relationship, I said to him:

> "U know what I already have previous relationship with some girl i met online 3 years ago. And we broke up 1 month ago. And i said to him honestly when we broke up, at the first time i don't really think about it, but turns out 3 weeks later the reminance of our relationship back then came into my mind and u know what, sometimes I evevn send message to her eventhough her didn't response on it, but honestly there's little part on me that still putting believe on her, that she would change and control her emotion, I even asked this on anonymous forum: \"I wonder how likely a girl change if i had a strong feedback on her that i can't live like this with her if she always want me to feed her own ego and she's a firm believer of 'the love on man must be a greater than the women love itself' \". Majority of the feedback said **NO**. if sshe want to change she would do that for herself. But love? Sure it will change anyone into a best version and a worst version. 

> "I said back to my friend: I even don't delete her photo on my gallery eventhough we didn't talk for almost 1 month because I put my trust on my 'little part', also sometimes her came into my dream which is imply she live on in my mind. All of this fake reality thing really make me tired on few days. I also become open to the internetsuggestion when i casually scrolling my tiktok account i found some content that talked about this, it's a female content btw. But actually the essence of the content is'I have to trust on myself and be brave to made a decison by 'kill' that little part because I don't live on that situation again and don't put your live on uncertainty."

And you know what he reply with this:

> "You already did your best for the relationship right? U have to acknowledge ur self, u have limit, even jesus has his own limit, it's our nature form, it's a normal thing don't being mean to your ownself, if she didn't care about your feedback it already tell she wont change. And stop put & spend ur mind & time on something like that, I agree with that people, it's hard for people to change if they don't want to commit on theyself. Time is ticking there's, take your time and don't think about her again kill the 'little part' on you and move on."
