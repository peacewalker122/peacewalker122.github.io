# The Painful Reality of Breakups

Does breakup good? **NO**, mark my word even though she's toxic & abusive breakup were painful to do. The little part of me keep complaining:

- Why I didn't stalk her account?
- Why I don't find any way to try communicate again with her?
- Why I keep avoid her?

Deep inside me, I miss her but on the other hand I hate her. I remember what Rumi said:

> No sound of clapping with just one hand

That implies that I couldn't be happy if kept dependent with her.

Now you've to imagine if you are me:

- You already have 3 years of relationship
- Communicate intensively with her for every single days
- She's being the only one place to talk for almost about everything:
  - Life
  - Career
  - Economic
  - Social
  - Politics
  - Future

Turns out that 'future' killing us. Sounds tragic isn't?
With her i got my lesson of life. i never know about the future but i never stop thinking about it. it's easy to say than be done, if i could time travel i wish not to talk about future.
